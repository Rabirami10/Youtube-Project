Skills take away From This Project: Python scripting, Data Collection, MongoDB, Streamlit, API integration, Data Managment using MongoDB (Atlas) and SQL

Domain: Social Media

# Introduction
This project is an application that demonstrates how to harvest and warehouse data from YouTube using SQL and MongoDB as the backend databases, and Streamlit for the user interface. It provides a straightforward way to extract video and channel information from YouTube, store it in a structured manner, and visualize the data through an interactive web application.

Whether you want to explore YouTube's data for analysis, build a recommendation system, or create data-driven insights, this project serves as a foundation to get started with collecting and managing YouTube data.

# Features
**Harvest YouTube channel data:** Gather channel details like name, description, subscribers, and more.

**Harvest YouTube video data:** Collect video information such as title, description, view count, likes, dislikes, etc.

**Warehouse data in SQL and MongoDB:** store the collected unstructed data in mongoDB. Make it structed and move the data to MySQL

**Interactive Web Interface:** Utilize Streamlit to create a user-friendly and interactive web application for data visualization.

**Customizable Queries:** Implement custom queries to filter, sort, and analyze the YouTube data.

# Technologies
